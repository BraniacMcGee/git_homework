Git is a wonderful tool for saving your work, making changes, and
collaborating

Learning HOW to learn and research is even more important than
rote memorization

Strategies
-Make more use of the supplemental resources available to me
-Be more involved in study group, the community, etc.

Shoutout to my amazing partner Faith for being my rock as I start this crazy new journey!
